/*Empty player names are accepted.

Selecting Cancel in the player-name prompt assigns "null" as the player's name.

Empty or mixed-case (for example, Skip, SkIp, skiP, etc.) input to the fight-or-skip prompt results in the fight option being chosen.

They also asked for the following new features:

Ability to save the high score.

Randomize who attacks first in each new confrontation.

Simplify the input process for the shop() prompt to reduce the amount of typing needed to reply to prompts.

As we complete the tasks for this lesson, we will learn how to do the following:

Store data by using the Web Storage API.

Validate player prompts by using the while loop.

Add more variability to the game by using the Math.random() function. */
